                    <entry>Terminology Knowledge Architecture (Tinkar) is intended to provide an
                        architecture that delivers integrated terminology to the enterprise and its
                        information systems, that addresses the differences in management and
                        structure across reference terminology and with local concepts and code
                        lists/value sets.</entry>

                    <entry> A common synonym for “path.” “Branch” implies an acyclical graph, which
                        is inaccurate, but it is widely used. </entry>

                        other assets. Paths “branch” from other paths when they are established, and

                        an interoperable payload technology. Publication implies that the publisher
                        has exercised some editorial judgment and warrants the validity and
                        consistency of the publication. </entry>

                        implies the implementation of rules and constraints asserted by both native

                        distinct sections or components with well-defined functionality and
                        dependencies. This approach allows individual sections to be able to be
                        reused, as well as worked on and updated independently to address new
                        requirements and use cases.</entry>

                        building blocks of the common model; and how the modules of the architecture
                        are tightly version controlled over time.</entry>

                        convert user-supplied terminologies into a single model using open-source
                        software to produce Solor content.</entry>
