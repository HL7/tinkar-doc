                    <entry>A development model that can be viewed as a set of structured levels that
                        describe how well  behaviors, practices and processes of an organization can
                        reliably and sustainably produce required outcomes. The model provides a
                        theoretical continuum for process maturity.</entry>

                        building blocks of the common model; and how the modules of the architecture
                        are tightly version controlled over time.</entry>

                            terminologies like SNOMED, LOINC, RxNorm shall be represented. Using the
                            Komet browser we can view &amp; search concepts, view concept details,
                            and navigate hierarchies among many other functions.</para>

                        structured sets of medical terms and codes that define concepts of interest,
                        including descriptions, dialects, language, and semantic hierarchy. SNOMED
                        CT, LOINC, and RxNorm are part of this layer.</entry>

                    <entry>A design principle that allows a complete system to be subdivided into
                        distinct sections or components with well-defined functionality and
                        dependencies. This approach allows individual sections to be able to be
                        reused, as well as worked on and updated independently to address new
                        requirements and use cases.</entry>

                        brings together terminology standards in a single model that can encompass
                        any customized content. Solor allows informaticists and developers to
                        convert user-supplied terminologies into a single model using open source
                        software to produce Solor content.</entry>
