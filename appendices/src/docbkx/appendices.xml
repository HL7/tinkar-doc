    <title>Tinkar Model Concepts</title>
    <para>The Tinkar core architecture is designed to be extremely flexible. This flexibility
        supports the ability to assert relationships among diverse terminologies and to support
        change in the design of those terminologies. However, it means that there may be more than
        one way to support any specific requirement. That level of flexibility, by permitting
        divergent designs, actually impedes interoperability. </para>
    <para>We propose the following members of the Tinkar Model Content.</para>
    <para>Tinkar concepts are defined hierarchically in a directed acyclic graph. This means that
        every class concept node in the repository has at least one “parent,” or concept
        relationship of type “is-a,” with the exception of one root node for clinical content and
        one root node for infrastructure content.</para>
