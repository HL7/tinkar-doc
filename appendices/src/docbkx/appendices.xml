    <title>Tinkar Model Concepts</title>
    <para>The Tinkar core architecture is designed to be extremely flexible. This flexibility
        supports the ability to assert relationships among diverse terminologies and to support
        change in the design of those terminologies. However, it means that there may be more than
        one way to support any specific requirement. That level of flexibility, by permitting
        divergent designs, actually impedes interoperability. We provide two levels of guidance to
        avoid this problem.</para>
