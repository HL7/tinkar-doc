    <para>The Tinkar core architecture is designed to be extremely flexible. This flexibility
        supports the ability to assert relationships among diverse terminologies and to support
        change in the design of those terminologies. However, it means that there may be more than
        one way to support any specific requirement. </para>
    <para>We propose the following members of the Tinkar Model Concepts. </para>
    <para>Below is an example of a subset of Tinkar Model Concepts. The full list and definitions of
        the core Tinkar Model Concepts is in progress and will be completed by the ballot submission
        deadline.</para>
